    "A1. A database is a collection of organized and structured data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It can be considered as an electronic filing system that stores data in a manner that enables efficient retrieval and manipulation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) databases are two main types of databases used in modern computing. Here are some of the key differences between them:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases are based on a tabular, relational data structure that consists of tables with rows and columns, where each row represents a unique record, and each column represents a data attribute. In contrast, NoSQL databases have a flexible data structure that allows data to be stored in various formats such as document, key-value, column-family, and graph-based data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema: SQL databases require a predefined schema, which specifies the data types, field names, and relationships between tables. On the other hand, NoSQL databases do not require a predefined schema and allow data to be added or modified on the fly, without affecting the rest of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, meaning they can handle a limited amount of data and require additional hardware resources as the data grows. In contrast, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning they can easily handle large amounts of data by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Querying: SQL databases use SQL queries to retrieve data from tables, which are highly structured and organized. In contrast, NoSQL databases use a variety of different query languages and techniques to access data stored in a flexible data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cases: SQL databases are commonly used in applications that require highly structured, consistent data, such as financial applications and accounting systems. NoSQL databases are commonly used in applications that require high scalability, flexibility, and real-time data processing, such as social media platforms, e-commerce sites, and mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are best suited for applications that require highly structured data and complex queries, while NoSQL databases are ideal for applications that require high scalability, performance, and flexibility."

    "A5. In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, while a foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a more detailed explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. It is used to enforce the integrity and consistency of the data in the table, and to ensure that each row can be accessed and modified accurately. The primary key is usually created when the table is created and is often an integer value that is automatically generated by the database management system. For example, in a table of employees, the primary key might be the \"employee ID\" column, which would contain a unique identifier for each employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to establish relationships between tables and to enforce referential integrity, which means that data in one table must match data in another table. For example, in a table of orders, there might be a \"customer ID\" column that refers to the \"customer ID\" column in a table of customers. This ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, primary keys and foreign keys are essential for creating relationships between tables in a relational database and for ensuring that the data in the tables is consistent and accurate. They are important concepts in database design and are used extensively in SQL to create, modify, and query data."

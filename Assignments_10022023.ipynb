    "In Python, the built-in function used to open a file is open(). This function takes two arguments: the name of the file to be opened (including the file path, if necessary) and the mode in which the file should be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file in Python are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Read mode (r): This mode is used to open a file for reading only. It is the default mode for open(). When a file is opened in read mode, its contents can be read, but not modified or written. Attempting to write to a file opened in read mode will result in a UnsupportedOperation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write mode (w): This mode is used to open a file for writing only. If the specified file already exists, its contents will be truncated (deleted) when it is opened in write mode. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Attempting to read from a file opened in write mode will result in a UnsupportedOperation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append mode (a): This mode is used to open a file for writing, but without truncating its contents. If the specified file already exists, any new data written to the file will be added to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. Attempting to read from a file opened in append mode will result in a UnsupportedOperation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary mode (b): This mode can be used with any of the other modes (r, w, or a) to indicate that the file should be opened in binary mode. In binary mode, the contents of the file are treated as binary data, rather than text data. This mode is useful when working with non-text files, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write mode (r+): This mode is used to open a file for both reading and writing. When a file is opened in this mode, its contents can be both read and modified. If the specified file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write and Read mode (w+): This mode is similar to r+ mode but truncates the file when opened. When a file is opened in this mode, its contents can be both read and modified. If the specified file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append and Read mode (a+): This mode is similar to r+ mode but the data is written at the end of the file. When a file is opened in this mode, its contents can be both read and modified. If the specified file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is important to close the file after using it, using the close() method on the file object. If the file is not closed, it may not be saved properly and resources may not be released.\n",

    "Data consistency: If a file is not closed properly, any changes made to the file may not be saved properly. This can lead to data corruption and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource management: When a file is opened, system resources such as memory and file handles are allocated to the process. If a file is not closed properly, these resources may not be released, which can cause performance issues and even system crashes if too many files are left open.\n",

    "Availability for other programs: If a file is left open, it cannot be accessed by other programs until it is closed. This can cause problems if other programs need to access the file.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python (and in general) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Encapsulation: This is the concept of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (i.e., a class) and restricting access to the data from outside the class. It helps to keep the data safe from accidental modification, and allows for better organization and modularity in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstraction: This is the concept of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the relevant information to the user. It helps to reduce complexity and makes the code easier to use and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Inheritance: This is the concept of creating a new class from an existing class, which inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class. It allows for code reuse, promotes modularity, and makes the code more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism: This is the concept of using a single interface to represent multiple forms (i.e., objects) of a class. It allows for flexibility and extensibility in the code, and enables code to work with objects of different types or classes in a uniform way."
